# For archives, use the standard chezmoi .chezmoiexternal file.
# However, since a single binary is typically installed in the ~/bin or ~/.local/bin directory,
# and the .chezmoiexternal mechanism expects to manage the entire directory,
# it cannot be used for individual binaries. That was the reason to create this script.
#
#
# The script run_before_15_web_binaries.sh.tmpl iterates over the URLs listed under web_binaries. 
# For each entry, it downloads the binary, which may be compressed. The script automatically detects 
# the compression algorithm, decompresses the file if needed, and installs it into the directory 
# specified by install_dir.
